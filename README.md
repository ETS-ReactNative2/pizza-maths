## Pizzarithmetic: For better life choices :pizza: :pizza: :pizza:
This project is the capstone project of [Stephen Whittaker](https://github.com/spwhittaker) and [Joanne](https://github.com/joannebasa) [Basa](https://joannebasa.com/) as part of the [Manchester Codes' ](https://www.manchestercodes.com/) Software Engineer Fast-Track course September 2019 cohort.

### About the App
Stephen had a vision: he wanted a way to check (like mathematically check) the **'most pizza for your money'**. In keeping up with the technologies we learned in this course, we have decided that we can use all the technologies we have learned, and more:

**Frontend** | **Backend** | **Other Methodologies** 
------------ | ------------- | -----------
HTML5 | Node.js | TDD
CSS3 + Sass | Express | Wireframing
React.js | Heroku  | Github

We also employed modern responsive and user experience design concepts, as well as doing daily 'standups' and kept a Trello board to monitor progress and continuously assess priorities and respond to problems in a timely manner.  
See Pizzarithmetic in action: 
+ deployed using Firebase: https://pizzarithmetic.web.app/
+ deployed using Vercel: https://pizza-maths.now.sh  
They are both Progressive Web Apps, feel free to save it on your phone (you're welcome :smile: )

### How to get started

Using the app is very intuitive-- just fill in the name, diameter/size (in cm or in) and the price of the pizza. It computes for the area (in sq. in or sq. cm) and the area to crust (size) ratio. 

### How to replicate Pizzarithmetic in your machine
* Pre-requisites: npm, node, Github || optional: hunger
* Open Terminal, clone Git repository: ```git clone git@github.com:spwhittaker/pizza-maths.git```
* Go into the folder: ```cd pizza-maths```
* Install node dependencies ```npm i```
* Fire away! ```npm start```

### Further Plans
This app is a work in progress. And future plans with this application include:
* more API integrations
* a React Native app version
* the ability to save favourites, login, etc.
